                    It is easier to get to the monastery from Chiaturi. A narrow and rather long staircase leads from Chiaturi to the monastery, after passing through which it is possible to enter the tunnel. The tunnel is man-made, quite long, and its roof is supported by supporting arches.</p>

In the temple, the wall frescoes are also preserved, including the portraits of the founder of this monastery in the 13th century, Rati Rachi Eristavi, his wife and brother, Niania Kakhaberisdze.
